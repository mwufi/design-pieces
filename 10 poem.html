One day it rained. One day a green 
inchworm crawled along his hand.
One night they held his head as he drank 
sharp-root wine from the fossilized cup. 
His mother, grandmother, and her older 
sister, knuckles bulky as oak-burls.
His mother, who was called the proud
in reverence or scorn. He lay on the table 
used for nothing except this. This: had
no name, though naming happened here.`,

            title: "The smokewood tree",
            content: `
The smokewood tree dropped its leaves 
in our hands and we sewed them
into living cups. We drank until
the leaves weathered, went shattery 
against our lips. We used our lips
for many things, talking, singing, 
lovemaking, except in the silent 
season, which was for harvest 
and contemplation when we 
forbid ourselves speech
and sealed ourselves
tight as the blue smokewood bark 
which holds to its trunk
with a layer of sap. In that sap
the night-flies hatch, and we let
our thoughts do the same, but
as for me, the silent season
is hard. It is blue out,
the blue is full of chattering
branches, their voices
covered not in moss, but
frost. Frost. Like a fur hood
I can’t fling back against my shoulders.`,

            title: "Wulf and eadwacer",
            content: `
The poem is either about a woman 
separated from a man by a petty 
tribal war, or about a woman 
forced to live with a second man 
because of a petty tribal war. 
Either way, she bears a child. 
Either way, one man is kept 
prisoner on an island, guarded
by bloodthirsty swords. Either 
way, the woman sits crying
in the rain, sheltered by trees, 
or it could be the rain is crying, 
or it could be there is no rain, 
she’s only using it as an image.

The second man, who is not
the island prisoner, whose name 
means possession- watcher,
comes to the woman to protect 
her, or imprison her, or because
he wants a woman just then,
and so fucks her. This feels good 
to her because she’s lonely, or
likes a good fuck sometimes,
or because she loves this second 
man, not the first. But afterwards 
it sickens her, out of loyalty
to the imprisoned man, or because 
the second man seemed pleasing 
at first, but then less so.

The child is sent to the woods 
to die or kill or escape with the 
island man, who may have got 
free of the bloodthirsty men
or stuck them with their own 
swords. Then there is either
an eagle or a cruelty, or cruelty
to the woman has always seemed 
inseparable from eagles, or the 
one who copied her poem 
suffered from partial blindness 
and wrote the wrong word 
entirely. Certainly sharp-edged 
things, carnage, slaughter. Or
the island was only an image,
and there was never an island,
she only meant we seemed so 
distant from each other we might 
as well be on two islands separated 
by a hard salted sea, and neither 
of us ship builders. In this case 
there were no islands, men, or
swords, but instead a hopeless
separateness ending in a wood
full of wolves or a man called
Wulf, and though she has known 
hunger, it is not hunger that carves 
her belly with dread but longing
for a man, or child, or wolf... (not finished)`,
