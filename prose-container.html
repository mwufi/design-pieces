      Phew, with any luck we have styled the headings above this text and they
      look pretty good. Let's add a closing <a href="">handy dandy</a> paragraph here so things end with a
      decently sized block of text. I can't explain why I want things to end
      that way but I have to assume it's because I think things will look weird
      or unbalanced if there is a heading too close to the end of the document.
      What I've written here is probably long enough, but adding this final
      sentence can't hurt. But a recent study shows that the celebrated
      appetizer may be linked to a series of rabies cases springing up around
      the country.

      For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread
      with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an iconic status
      in our culture that kids will often dress up as warm, cheesy loaf for
      Halloween.
